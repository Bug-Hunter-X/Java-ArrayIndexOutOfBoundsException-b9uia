# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The example code attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds, leading to this runtime exception.  The solution shows how to prevent this by checking array bounds before accessing elements.

## Running the code

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile `Bug.java` using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac Bug.java`).
3. Run the compiled code (e.g., `java Bug`).  Observe the exception.
4. Compile and run `BugSolution.java` to see the corrected version.
